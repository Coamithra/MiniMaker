- A service that allows users to upload text descriptions of their D&D character and that creates a 3D printable model for them.
- Service has a website frontend.
- Service backend is python based.
- Service uses local models, hosted on AWS (or maybe Azure or Google, doesn't really matter) on-demand.
- Service performs:
  1. Use image generation AI to create a front and back image of the character, with some minor prompt injection to make it look like a D&D mini.
  2. Use a 2d-to-3d model generation AI to create the 3D model (I like Tencent's hunyuan)
  3. "Thicken" the model, ie make sure there are no areas that are too thin to print properly.
  4. Allow model for download

We'll need to do a bunch of steps to get here, I imagine something like:

Step 1:

Create a dummy website for me to host, with a single "generate" button.

Step 2:

Create and host a cloud service that uses a local image model to create some image, and hook that up to our "generate" button. Needs to be lean, so some on-demand server seems like the way to go, probably using a docker image? Not sure I am not an expert webdev.

Step 3:

A second service to generate a 3d model, at this stage can just use a preset image and generate the model when pressing "generate".

Step 4:

Combine both services so that the generate button creates two images (back and front view, can use a fixed prompt for now for what the image should be), then creates the model from those and allows the user to download that.

Step 5:

Integrate the workflow of the user being able to type their description in a textbox and the models using that to generate the model, as well as some nicer UI on the website (a 3D view would be cool).

Step 6:

Add another step to the pipeline for thickening the model. This could be a rather complicated procedure so we should be able to iterate on it locally before turning it into another cloud service.

I think that's about it?
